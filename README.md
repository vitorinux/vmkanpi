# Install from source Kannel 1.4.5 on RPI 3 model B+

Introduction

	The Kannel Open Source WAP and SMS gateway works as both an SMS
	gateway, for implementing keyword based services via GSM text
	messages, and a WAP gateway, via UDP. The SMS part is fairly
	mature, the WAP part is early in its development. In this release,
	the GET request for WML pages and WMLScript files via HTTP works,
	including compilation for WML and WMLScript to binary forms. Only
	the data call bearer (UDP) is supported, not SMS.
